# rule for uploading firmware:

# rule for deleting dependent files (those which can be built by Make):
clean:
	rm -f main.lst main.obj main.cof main.list main.map main.eep.hex main.elf *.o usbdrv/*.o main.s usbdrv/oddebug.s usbdrv/usbdrv.s

# Generic rule for compiling C files:
.c.o:
	$(COMPILE) -c $< -o $@

# Generic rule for assembling Assembler source files:
.S.o:
	$(COMPILE) -x assembler-with-cpp -c $< -o $@
# "-x assembler-with-cpp" should not be necessary since this is the default
# file type for the .S (with capital S) extension. However, upper case
# characters are not always preserved on Windows. To ensure WinAVR
# compatibility define the file type manually.

# Generic rule for compiling C to assembler, used for debugging only.
.c.s:
	$(COMPILE) -S $< -o $@

# file targets:

# Since we don't want to ship the driver multipe times, we copy it into this project:
usbdrv:
	cp -r ../usbdrv .
